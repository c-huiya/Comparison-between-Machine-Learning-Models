# Comparison-between-Machine-Learning-Models
This Jupyter Notebook compares the accuracy of 2 machine learning models, Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting, to predict Parkinson's Disease using a biomedical voice dataset. I cleaned and visualized the data, trained the models, and evaluated them using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
